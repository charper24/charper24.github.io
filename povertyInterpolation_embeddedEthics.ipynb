Using Python as the primary programming language, the course covers fundamental programming constructs, data structures, file handling, and an introduction to data visualization techniques. By applying these skills to real-world datasets and problems, students gain practical experience and develop interdisciplinary connections. Designed for students without prior programming experience, the course aims to create a supportive learning environment that inspires students to further hone their computational abilities and critical thinking skills.\n","\n","---\n","\n","<h4><b>Module Topic:</b><u>Designing Methods to Estimate US Poverty Data Using Spatial Interpolation and Ethical Considerations</u><h4>\n","\n","---\n","\n","<b>Note:</b> This module focuses on the technical aspects and hands-on exercises related to spatial interpolation and data-driven decision-making. It builds upon the foundation established in previous lectures, where guest a speaker from the Department of Philosophy provided an introduction to ethical considerations in computer science applications.\n","\n","<b>Acknowledgment:</b> This module was co-developed by <a href=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~charper/\">Colton Harper</a> and Zachariah Wrublewski.\n","\n","\n","<h4><b><u>Module Overview:</u></b></h4>\n","\n","In this module, students work with an interactive Python notebook that guides them through the process of designing, coding, and evaluating a method to estimate US poverty data using spatial interpolation techniques. The primary focus is on exploring the ethical considerations involved in designing and implementing data-driven solutions, as well as understanding the implications of these decisions on various stakeholders.\n","\n","---\n","<h4><b><u>Learning Objectives:</u></b></h4>\n","Through hands-on coding exercises, collaborative problem-solving, and reflective discussions, students will:\n","\n","1. Enhance students' understanding of the ethical considerations in using spatial interpolation methods for estimating poverty data in real-world scenarios.\n","2. Encourage students to think critically about the potential consequences of their methodological choices for various stakeholders, including direct and indirect ones.\n","3. Reinforce students' ability to apply spatial interpolation techniques while considering the ethical dimensions of their work.\n","\n","\n","<h4><b><u>Key Questions:</u></b></h4>\n","\n","- What ethical considerations should be taken into account when using spatial interpolation methods to estimate poverty data?\n","- How do the choices made in designing a method impact various stakeholders, both directly and indirectly?\n","- How can students balance the need for accurate estimations with the ethical implications of their work?\n","\n","<h4><b><u>Key Concepts:</u></b></h4>\n","\n","- Ethical dimensions in spatial interpolation and data-driven decision-making\n","Identifying and addressing the needs of direct and indirect stakeholders\n","- Evaluating trade-offs and potential

Well, we'll have to think about it and test it out.\n","  - We have the 2015 data, which seems like it might correlate somewhat with the 2020 data.

So, what if we identify the counties from 2015 that had the highest poverty rates and use those counties as our samples?\n","\n","#### **Method #3**\n","**Representative Sample**\n","  - Let's also try sampling in a way where we try to get counties that have the highest poverty rates and the lowest poverty rates.\n","  - Based on the 2015 data, we can sample 25% of the counties that have the highest poverty rates.\n","  - We can also sample the 25% of counties that have the lowest poverty rates.\n","\n","#### **Other**\n","There are many more ways to sample the data, many of which will likely lead to better results than the above sampling methods.

where it makes sense to apply spatial interpolation methods include:\n","- Estimating the rainfall in various neighborhoods when you have some rainfall data of the surrounding neighborhoods.\n","  - It makes sense to apply spatial interpolation here because the data is spatially correlated.

We will only consider IDW for this lab.\n","\n","**How IDW Works:**\n","\n","IDW allows you to estimate one point by conducting a weighted average of the neighboring points around it. The farther away a point is, the less it contributes to the estimate.\n","\n","There are two main settings to IDW that you can change to improve your estimations.\n","  - **Number of Neighbors** The number of neighbors to consider in your estimation. The default tends to be about 5 neighbors.\n","  - **Power** The power governs how much neighboring points of different distances impact the value of the estimated point.\n","    - A lower power allows farther points to have a higher impact on the estimated point\n","    - A high power makes neighbors farther away impact the estimated point less\n","    - The default power tends to be 2\n","\n","The image below illustrates a plane with four known values (in red) and a value we want to interpolate (in purple).

We can consider some common measures, but we may want to develop a measure more customized for our context. In general, our performance measure is going to be some function of the error between our poverty rate estimates and the actual value.\n","\n","**Recall the General Goal:** To develop a map with estimated values that may eventually be used to inform how funds are distributed to people in poverty.\n","\n","We want our performance measure to align with this aim. We can change elements of our method design, and check the performance using our performance measure. We can iteratively adapt the design and optimize to find what we think will be the 'best' design.\n","\n","**Performance Measures We'll Consider:**\n","1. **Average Percent Error**\n","  - In general the error of an estimate is just: `actualValue - estimatedValue`\n","  - The average percent error is just an average of each of these errors\n","  - **Limitation** a key limitation of this method is that we can have a 0% error even when we have large errors. Consider the case of an error where we overestimate a value by 10% and underestimate a value by 10%. Our average error of these two estimates would average to be 0% error.\n","2. **Average Absolute Error**\n","  - Average absolute error takes the average of the absolute value of the percent error. This way, we can see the average magnitude of error.\n","  - **Limitation** a huge error counts just about as much as a small error\n","3. **Mean Squared Error**\n","  - The mean squared error squares each of the errors and then averages them.\n","  - Since the error is squared before it is averaged, large errors penalize the performance score by a lot more than small errors do.\n","  - **Limitation** the mean squared error is a relative measure and only really makes sense when you are comparing the mean squared error of two models.\n","4. **Root Mean Squared Error**\n","  - This method is the square root of the mean squared error\n","  - This is often used in machine learning\n","5. **Binary Classification of Error Below a Threshold**\n","  - This measure calculates the percentage of estimations whose absolute error is less than a certain value. (e.g., what percent of our estimations have less than a 3% error?)\n","6. **Errors 1-4 by Poverty Quartile** (Lowest poverty, \"middle low\" poverty, \"middle-high\" poverty, and Highest poverty)\n","  - We want to make sure we have high accuracy estimates particularly for households in high poverty, since resource distribution decisions may be made on this basis.\n","  - It may make sense for us to look at the error measures among subgroups. This measure, measure the above poverty errors, but does so for the poverty quartiles.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oTihMXa83e-c"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Get the real values that correspond to the interpolated values\n","sample_1_interp_withActual = idw_interpolation.getRealvaluesGivenInterpolated(censusData2020, sample_1_interp)\n","\n","# Calculate the error\n","error_calculator = ErrorCalculator()\n","percentBound = 3\n","errors = error_calculator.getErrors(sample_1_interp_withActual, percentBound, printErrors=True)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nzKuxboM3iCB","outputId":"da9bf4db-e550-4421-eea8-f03710991fbe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681245093182,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Colton Harper","userId":"10023392459509014862"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Average Error: 0.9200634313461862\n","Average Absolute Error: 3.9479899560221123\n","Mean Squared Error: 24.579337782437346\n","Root Mean Squared Error: 4.957755316918872\n","Percent Predicted With Smaller than a 3% error: 46.808%\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result = error_calculator.getErrorsByQuartile(sample_1_interp_withActual, percentBound, printErrors=True)\n","quartile_errors = result['quartile_errors']\n","poverty_ranges = result['poverty_ranges']\n","quartile_errors"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nbabFC9q9mWU","outputId":"ff45fcbb-2050-4f13-db3b-d4191289187d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681245156152,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":516,"user":{"displayName":"Colton Harper","userId":"10023392459509014862"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ERROR FOR QUARTILE #1 -- 3.2% poverty to 6.7% poverty:\n","\n","ERROR FOR QUARTILE #2 -- 7.2% poverty to 10.7% poverty:\n","\n","ERROR FOR QUARTILE #3 -- 10.9% poverty to 14.5% poverty:\n","\n","ERROR FOR QUARTILE #4 -- 14.7% poverty to 22.2% poverty:\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-1-7f5521f72acd>:488: FutureWarning:\n","\n","The default value of numeric_only in DataFrame.quantile is deprecated.

Possible reasons:\n","\n","1. Random sampling method might not provide a representative sample across poverty levels, leading to insufficient data for accurate interpolation.\n","2. The choice of power and the number of nearest neighbors in IDW method might not be optimal for all poverty levels, causing bias in estimates.\n","\n","These design decisions have implications:\n","\n","1. Inaccurate poverty estimates can impact resource allocation and support for people in need, causing disparities in assistance.\n","2.
